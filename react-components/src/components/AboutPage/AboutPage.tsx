              <p>
                Our knowledge engineers spent years crafting our complex food ontology, which allows
                us to understand the relationships between ingredients, recipes, nutrition,
                allergens, and more. We understand &quot;nut free&quot; muffins can&apos;t contain
                pecans (even if the recipe doesn&apos;t mention &quot;nuts&quot; anywhere!) and we
                automatically determine that a recipe with Worcestershire sauce isn&apos;t
                vegetarian (we&apos;re looking at you, anchovies.)

            <h3>Gluten Free</h3>
            <p>
              Eliminating gluten means avoiding wheat, barley, rye, and other gluten-containing
              grains and foods made from them (or that may have been cross contaminated).
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="diet__card">
            <h3>Ketogenic</h3>
            <p>
              The keto diet is based more on the ratio of fat, protein, and carbs in the diet rather
              than specific ingredients. Generally speaking, high fat, protein-rich foods are
              acceptable and high carbohydrate foods are not. The formula we use is 55-80% fat
              content, 15-35% protein content, and under 10% of carbohydrates.

            <h3>Vegetarian</h3>
            <p>No ingredients may contain meat or meat by-products, such as bones or gelatin.</p>

          <div className="diet__card">
            <h3>Primal</h3>
            <p>
              Very similar to Paleo, except dairy is allowed - think raw and full fat milk, butter,
              ghee, etc.
            </p>

          <div className="diet__card">
            <h3>Vegan</h3>
            <p>
              No ingredients may contain meat or meat by-products, such as bones or gelatin, nor may
              they contain eggs, dairy, or honey.
            </p>

          <div className="diet__card">
            <h3>Paleo</h3>
            <p>
              Allowed ingredients include meat (especially grass fed), fish, eggs, vegetables, some
              oils (e.g. coconut and olive oil), and in smaller quantities, fruit, nuts, and sweet
              potatoes. We also allow honey and maple syrup (popular in Paleo desserts, but strict
              Paleo followers may disagree)...

            <h3>Low FODMAP</h3>
            <p>
              FODMAP stands for &quot;fermentable oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyols&quot;.
              Our ontology knows which foods are considered high in these types of carbohydrates
              (e.g. legumes, wheat, and dairy products)

            <h3>Whole30</h3>
            <p>
              Allowed ingredients include meat, fish/seafood, eggs, vegetables, fresh fruit, coconut
              oil, olive oil, small amounts of dried fruit and nuts/seeds. Ingredients not allowed
              include added sweeteners (natural and artificial, except small amounts of fruit
              juice), dairy (except clarified butter or ghee), alcohol, grains, legumes...
